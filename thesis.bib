Online backup is the most developed application based on cloud storage. Most past studies focus on functional characters and price per GB. But there is not much consideration about performance evaluation. In this paper, the authors present a method to evaluate the performance of different online backup services with clients. Because these clients do not prompt when the download/upload process starts and finishes, the authors capture the packets transferred between clients and the cloud storage provider. The authors evaluate the performance from the view of the end-user, comparing the upload and download speeds of different services. This method can help users find the best provider to accommodate their situation. The authors evaluate the performance of several cloud storage providers by analyzing the performance of different vendors in different times and different file type and size. From the performance results, the authors can expose which technologies are used in the cloud storage system to reduce the storage and network cost.},

Ransomware, as a type of malware to extort ransom payments from victims, has evolved to deliver payloads in different attack vectors and on multiple platforms, and creating repeated disruptions and financial loss to many victims. Many studies have performed ransomware analysis and/or presented detection, defense, or prevention techniques for ransomware. However, because the ransomware landscape has evolved aggressively, many of those studies have become less relevant or even outdated. Previous surveys on anti-ransomware studies have compared the methods and results of the studies they surveyed, but none of those surveys has attempted to critique on the internal or external validity of those studies. In this survey, we first examined the up-to-date concept of ransomware, and listed the inadequacies in current ransomware research. We then proposed a set of unified metrics to evaluate published studies on ransomware mitigation, and applied the metrics to 118 such studies to comprehensively compare and contrast their pros and cons, with the attempt to evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we forecast the future trends of ransomware evolution, and propose future research directions.},

We also provide a holistic view on how ransomware attacks have evolved during this period by analyzing 1,359 samples that belong to 15 different ransomware families. Our results show that, despite a continuous improvement in the encryption, deletion, and communication techniques in the main ransomware families, the number of families with sophisticated destructive capabilities remains quite small. In fact, our analysis reveals that in a large number of samples, the malware simply locks the victim’s computer desktop or attempts to encrypt or delete the victim’s files using only superficial techniques. Our analysis also suggests that stopping advanced ransomware attacks is not as complex as it has been previously reported. For example, we show that by monitoring abnormal file system activity, it is possible to design a practical defense system that could stop a large number of ransomware attacks, even those using sophisticated encryption capabilities. A close examination on the file system activities of multiple ransomware samples suggests that by looking at I/O requests and protecting Master File Table (MFT) in the NTFS file system, it is possible to detect and prevent a significant number of zero-day ransomware attacks.},

	abstract = {Preventive and reactive security measures can only partially mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware attacks. Indeed, the remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cyber-criminals' increasing interest in ransomware schemes suggest that a fair number of users are actually paying the ransoms. Unfortunately, pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes or pipelines) are not sufficient nowadays, because often we do not have the luxury of being able to isolate a sample to analyze, and when this happens it is already too late for several users! We believe that a forward-looking solution is to equip modern operating systems with practical self-healing capabilities against this serious threat. Towards such a vision, we propose ShieldFS, an add-on driver that makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware attacks. For each running process, ShieldFS dynamically toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-on-write mechanism, according to the outcome of its detection component. Internally, ShieldFS monitors the low-level filesystem activity to update a set of adaptive models that profile the system activity over time. Whenever one or more processes violate these models, their operations are deemed malicious and the side effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back. We designed ShieldFS after an analysis of billions of low-level, I/O filesystem requests generated by thousands of benign applications, which we collected from clean machines in use by real users for about one month. This is the first measurement on the filesystem activity of a large set of benign applications in real working conditions. We evaluated ShieldFS in real-world working conditions on real, personal machines, against samples from state of the art ransomware families. ShieldFS was able to detect the malicious activity at runtime and transparently recover all the original files. Although the models can be tuned to fit various filesystem usage profiles, our results show that our initial tuning yields high accuracy even on unseen samples and variants.},

Role based access control (RBAC) (also called 'role based security'), as formalized in 1992 by David Ferraiolo and Rick Kuhn, has become the predominant model for advanced access control because it reduces this cost.    This project site explains RBAC concepts, costs and benefits, the economic impact of RBAC, design and implementation issues, the RBAC standard, and advanced research topics. The NIST model for RBAC was adopted as American National Standard 359-2004 by the American National Standards Institute, International Committee for Information Technology Standards (ANSI/INCITS) on February 11, 2004. It was revised as INCITS 359-2012 in 2012. See the RBAC standard section for more information.

	abstract = {Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterpriseowned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security posture.},

	abstract = {This chapter will focus on the actual conduct of operations, the focal point being the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by hacker groups when waging cyber guerilla. Before engaging in operations it is essential to take precautions to counter being profiled (counterintelligence). After having taken precautionary measures, the hacker group can engage in operations. There are various (often sequential) stages in operations and there are many models categorizing these stages. This chapter infuses the cyber kill chain with the advanced persistent threat life cycle resulting in the following stages: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, initial compromise, escalate privileges, internal reconnaissance, move laterally, maintain presence, and complete mission. These operations are aimed to further the goals of the hacker group. A variety of effects can be attained via operations, such as: inform, mislead, cognitively degrade, deny, disrupt, and destroy. After or during successful operations the hacker group can decide to seek exposure; to be able to do this effectively the hacker group should conduct a target group analysis and formulate a media strategy. Once the hacker group has achieved its end-goal via series of successful operations, the hacker group should decide on the future of the hacker group. They can take on a new issue area or (partially) retire, in this case they should work out an exit strategy.},

	abstract = {In 1989 the first extortion for currency using a Trojan called AIDS was logged in history, revealing a new threat to data and resources of individuals and organizations, globally known as ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that has the ability to duplicate itself on a network, affecting devices by locking access to these devices or encrypting data where only the attacker has the decryption key to restore this affected data. This gives the attacker the privilege to demand an amount of money, or a ransom, in order to send the decryption key to the victim, or unlock their device. This paper aims to propose a matrix of measures used to assess the vulnerability of IoT devices or systems to the threat of ransomware, which allows different entities to be prepared for this kind of attack, through shedding the light on ransomware as a major issue threatening today's modern life, from smart cars, smart homes, electronic health records, to planted heart pacemakers; by presenting some previous ransomware attack cases, presenting and discussing some of the current ransomware detection or prevention techniques.},

This systematic literature analysed the anatomy of ransomware, including its trends and mode of attacks to find the possible solutions by querying various academic literature. In contrast to previous reviews, sources of ransomware dataset are revealed in this review paper to ease the challenges of researchers in getting access to ransomware datasets. In addition, a taxonomy of ransomware current trends is presented in the paper. We discussed the articles in detail, the evolution and trend in ransomware researches. Most of the techniques deployed could not completely prevent ransomware attacks because of its obfuscation techniques, but rather recommend proper and regular backup of important files.

One year later, we aimed to replicate this effort for a representative German population (N=963) to study the spread of ransomware in a different context. Our findings suggest some differences between the two samples concerning payment methods and the participants’ way of dealing with ransomware. Other aspects, like the ransom amounts and behavioral changes after an attack, were largely similar. We extend prior work by examining disagreements and uncertainty in judging whether a ransomware attack occurred for participants and researchers alike.},

Notable attacks have been spreading since 2012, starting with Reveton's ransomware attack to the more recent 2017 WannaCry, Petya and Bad Rabbit cyberattacks. This Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) can lure criminals into developing tools to perform an attack without previous knowledge of the cryptosystem itself. We present in this paper a graph-based ransomware countermeasure to detect malicious threads. It is a new mechanism that doesn't rely on previously used metrics in the literature to detect ransomware such as Shannon's entropy or system calls. An accurate detection is achieved by our solution. The per-thread file system traversal is sufficient to highlight the malicious behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted in this area. The ransomware collection used in our experiments contains more than 700 active examples of ransomware, that were analyzed in our bar metal sandbox environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract—In this paper, we propose a routing technique, “recursive Loop-Free Alternates (rLFAs)”, to alleviate packet loss due to transient link failures. The technique consists of a backup path calculation with corresponding re-routing scheme based on the Loop-Free Condition (LFC) as defined in the basic specification for IP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR). Under this routing strategy, nodes calculate backup paths by modifying the weights of links in the primary shortest path tree. If a failure occurs, the detecting node determines the number of recursions, which indicates the number of times packets must be forwarded along the alternate next hops to bypass the failed link. This technique guarantees full repair coverage for single link failures. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique through simulations and show that the incurred overheads, the stretch of its pre-computed alternate paths, and the failure-state Maximum Link Utilisation (MLU) are minimal.

The recent resurgence of high-profile ransomware attacks, particularly in critical sectors such as the health care industry, has highlighted the pressing need for effective defenses. While users are always advised to have a reliable backup strategy, the growing number of paying victims in recent years suggests that an endpoint defense that is able to stop and recover from ransomware’s destructive behavior is needed.In this paper, we introduce Redemption, a novel defense that makes the operating system more resilient to ransomware attacks. Our approach requires minimal modification of the operating system to maintain a transparent buffer for all storage I/O. At the same time, our system monitors the I/O request patterns of applications on a per-process basis for signs of ransomware-like behavior. If I/O request patterns are observed that indicate possible ransomware activity, the offending processes can be terminated and the data restored.Our evaluation demonstrates that Redemption can ensure zero data loss against current ransomware families without detracting from the user experience or inducing alarm fatigue. In addition, we show that Redemption incurs modest overhead, averaging 2.6\% for realistic workloads.},

Ransomware is one of the types of malware which is the result of sophisticated attempt to compromise the modern computer systems. The governments and large corporations are investing heavily to combat this cyber threat against their critical infrastructure. It has been observed that over the last few years that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have become the main target of Ransomware due to the sensitive operations involved in the day to day processes of these industries. As the technology is evolving, more and more traditional industrial systems are replaced with advanced industry methods involving advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT). These technology shift help improve business productivity and keep the company's global competitive in an overflowing competitive market. However, the systems involved need secure measures to protect integrity and availability which will help avoid any malfunctioning to their operations due to the cyber-attacks. There have been several cyber-attack incidents on healthcare, pharmaceutical, water cleaning and energy sector. These ICS' s are operated by remote control facilities and variety of other devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) and sensors to make a network. Cyber criminals are exploring vulnerabilities in the design of these ICS's to take the command and control of these systems and disrupt daily operations until ransomware is paid.

	abstract = {There has been significant growth in ransomware attacks over the past few years. Many organizations have been affected by a variety of ransomware attacks, leading to a large amount of data becoming inaccessible. In a typical ransomware attack malicious software encrypts electronic data while extorting money from an unexpecting victim. In order to decrypt and restore data, the attacker requests user to pay the ransom amount, typically through crypto-currency such as Bitcoin. There are various ways how ransomware infiltrate a computer, including phishing emails, drive-by downloads or vulnerable websites containing executable files of the malware. Being a new emerging type of attack, limited consolidated information is known by users. Therefore, this paper sets out to perform a systematic literature review to determine what has been published during the previous 3 years in leading academic journals regarding the prevention and mitigation of ransomware. Two hundred and sixty one (261) journal articles dealt with ransomware from four perspectives: prevention and mitigation methods, detection methods, case studies and attack methods. Out of the 261 journal articles, 35 journal articles that resort under the prevention and mitigation category were further analyzed. The papers were coded and a consolidated list of 13 guidelines was constructed. Interestingly, and somewhat concerning, these prevention and mitigation guidelines cover basic cyber-security practices to prevent and mitigate against any kind of cyber-attack, not specifically ransomware. This raises questions regarding the research agenda, but the repetition of established guidelines also raises questions on the effectiveness of security education, training and awareness interventions.},

	abstract = {The growth of malware poses a major threat to internet users, governments, and businesses around the world. One of the major types of malware, ransomware, encrypts a user's sensitive information and only returns the original files to the user after a ransom is paid. As malware developers shift the delivery of their product from HTTP to HTTPS to protect themselves from payload inspection, we can no longer rely on deep packet inspection to extract features for malware identification. Toward this goal, we propose a solution leveraging a recent trend in networking hardware, that is programmable forwarding engines (PFEs). PFEs allow collection of per-packet, network monitoring data at high rates. We use this data to monitor the network traffic between an infected computer and the command and control (C\&C) server. We extract high-level flow features from this traffic and use this data for ransomware classification. We write a stream processor and use a random forest, binary classifier to utilizes these rich flow records in fingerprinting malicious, network activity without the requirement of deep packet inspection. Our classification model achieves a detection rate in excess of 0.86, while maintaining a false negative rate under 0.11. Our results suggest that a flow-based fingerprinting method is feasible and accurate enough to catch ransomware before encryption.},

In the early years, ransomware has used e-mails as attack method. The most common spreading method was through spam mail or harmful websites. In addition, social networking sites or smartphone messages are used. Ransomware can encrypt the user’s files and issues a warning message to the user and requests payment through bitcoin, which is a virtual currency that is hard to trace. It is possible to analyze ransomware but this has its limitations as new ransomware is being continuously created and disseminated. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ransomware prevention system based on abnormal behavior analysis and detection in cloud analysis system—CloudRPS. This proposed system can defend against ransomware through more in-depth prevention. It can monitors the network, file, and server in real time. Furthermore, it installs a cloud system to collect and analyze various information from the device and log information to defend against attacks. Finally, the goal of the system is to minimize the possibility of the early intrusion. And it can detect the attack quickly more to prevent at the user’s system in case of the ransomware compromises.},

It does that by creating a denial of service of a system to its own user by encrypting files and/or locking the machine. The malware takes advantage of people’s fear of revealing their private information, losing their critical data, or facing serious hardware damage. Some of the most recent well-known ransomware include WannaCry, Petya, Bad Rabbit, and Baltimore City. Ransomware creators use a special technique called obfuscation to evade detection by antivirus software. The degree of antivirus detection depends on the complexity of the obfuscation process. The purpose of this research is to assess the efficiency of current malware analysis methods and technologies in the detection of ransomware as well as prevention methods to keep files safe using cloud computing. The experiments presented here were performed using antivirus engines and dynamic malware analysis against live obfuscated ransomware samples.},

A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used.

Regularly backing up data is essential to protecting data in the computing system against the growing number of malware by using the remote cloud servers or local Network Attached Storage(NAS) servers. However, the traditional cloud servers and NAS are not entirely safe for malware like ransomware. In this paper, we propose a robust and secure region-based backup system against malware attacks. The proposed backup system is divided into 3 regions: Un-safe, Middle, and Safe regions, depending on the risk of malware infections. The un-safe region is a common file system that is prone to malware attacks because it is mounted on the local machine. The safe region is isolated from the remote computer system over the Internet as well as the local computer system. The middle region is changed to the safe region only if this region is guaranteed that it is not infected with malware. We evaluate the reliability of the propose system based on the fault tolerance modeling.},

Majority of ransomware families are requesting for a ransom payment to restore a custodian access or decrypt data which were encrypted by the ransomware earlier. Although the ransomware attack strategy seems to be simple, security specialists ranked ransomware as a sophisticated attack vector with many variations and families. Wide range of features which are available in different families and versions of ransomware further complicates their detection and analysis. Though the existing body of research provides significant discussions about ransomware details and capabilities, the all research body is fragmented. Therefore, a ransomware feature taxonomy would advance cyber defenders’ understanding of associated risks of ransomware. In this paper we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first scientific taxonomy of ransomware features, aligned with Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) model. CKC is a well-established model in industry that describes stages of cyber intrusion attempts. To ease the challenge of applying our taxonomy in real world, we also provide the corresponding ransomware defence taxonomy aligned with Courses of Action matrix (an intelligence-driven defence model). We believe that this research study is of high value for the cyber security research community, as it provides the researchers with a means of assessing the vulnerabilities and attack vectors towards the intended victims.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is currently becoming a well-known buzzword in which business titans, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, among others, are at the forefront in developing and providing sophisticated cloud computing systems to their users in a cost-effective manner. Security is the biggest concern for cloud computing and is a major obstacle to users adopting cloud computing systems. Maintaining the security of cloud computing is important, especially for the infrastructure. Several research works have been conducted in the cloud infrastructure security area; however, some gaps have not been completely addressed, while new challenges continue to arise. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the security issues at different cloud infrastructure levels (e.g., application, network, host, and data). It investigates the most prominent issues that may affect the cloud computing business model with regard to infrastructure. It further discusses the current solutions proposed in the literature to mitigate the different security issues at each level. To assist in solving the issues, the challenges that are still unsolved are summarized. Based on the exploration of the current challenges, some cloud features such as flexibility, elasticity and the multi-tenancy are found to pose new challenges at each infrastructure level. More specifically, the multi-tenancy is found to have the most impact at all infrastructure levels, as it can lead to several security problems such as unavailability, abuse, data loss and privacy breach. This survey concludes by giving some recommendations for future research.},

The truth is that all vendors that use disk as their storage mechanism can at best say they have an electronic or virtual airgap. Since everything is still on disk somewhere, even if that somewhere is in the cloud, there is a risk that something could happen to the backup copy. A way around this problem is to send the backups to disk first. Because a disk is a random-access device, it can write data as it comes in, pause, and write the next chunk of data as it comes in without suffering performance loss.},

Often however, such systems can be hard to set up, generate large amounts of unfiltered data, and must be carefully monitored to prevent their being used as a platform for further attacks. This paper discusses the development of a honeynet system that computing professionals and researchers can set up, scale, and use with relative ease. The system monitors intruders' activities on individual honeypots then aggregates their movements into a single database, making the data easily accessible and searchable for study through a graphical front-end. To test this open-source solution, the authors replicate a portion of a seminal criminological study by Maimon et al. [4] finding corroborating evidence that system warning banner messages can produce significant effects limiting hackers' time spent on compromised computer systems.},
