\chapter*{Abstract}

Ransomware attacks have been on the rise globally the last few years. They pose a serious threat to any business's data, reputation and operational capability.
Backups are an essential part of an effective strategy against ransomware attacks, 
functioning as the last line of defense.
Thus; how do you prevent a hacker from corrupting or outright deleting your backups 
before unleashing their ransomware?

In this thesis, we attempt to find the trends and characteristics that define modern ransomware,
as well as how to recover from modern ransomware attacks.
We explore various backup solutions for managed and unmanaged 
databases in Azure, the cloud service platform operated by Microsoft, and evaluate their effectiveness against modern ransomware attacks.
In addition, we look at security mechanisms and features in Azure that can help defend
backups from malicious actions.

The results address several security features which block a number of attack vectors. Furthermore, issues with the existing backup solutions are highlighted and in some cases suggestions for improvement proposed.
