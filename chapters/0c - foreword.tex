\chapter*{Preface}
This thesis was written as the final assignment of our bachelors degree in digital infrastructure and cybersecurity. It explores the cross-section between infrastructure and security: Security controls against ransomware in databases hosted in a public cloud environment.

We were motivated to write this thesis because we felt it was both relevant and important to organisations facing the growing threat of ransomware. No other theme has been as prevalent in cybersecurity news during our degree. The choice to focus on cloud environments is both relevant for today, but will remain relevant for years to come as well.

We hope this thesis is relevant to organisations unsure of how to assess the myriad of security features in cloud environments, and help them stay secure. 

We would like to thank Tr√∏nderEnergi for help with the project, NTNU for the opportunity to study relevant and important subjects. We would also like to thank our advisors: Helge Hafting, Gleb Sizov, and Joakim Klemets. All your advice helped us greatly.
